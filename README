I can promise you that the function I provided below works absolutely well if you stricly follow my instruction. Unfortunately, my program does not support to change the value of the knots. I am sorry for that. And, to show how my program works directly, I also provide a video for it.

1)To create a new curve, press 'i' on the graph window and follow exactly(!!!) the instruction provided on terminal. If you want to create a new curve, press i to close the creation of current curve and press i to start a new curve.
2)To add a new vertex on a certain curver, please press 'a' on the graph window and input the curve id and follow the instrcutions provided on the terminal strictly. If you want to turn off the add mode, press a again.
3)To delete a vertex on any curve, press 'd' and selet the vertex you want to delete by mouse on the graph window, the program will delete it for you. If you want to turn off the delete mode, press d again.
4)To change a vertex on any curve, please press 'p' and select the control point by mouse on the graph window and selet a new coordinate for it by mouse on the graph window. If you want to move another control point, press p to stop the position change of the current point and press p again to start a new one.
5)To clear all curves. press 'c' on the graph window
6)To switch between Bezier curve and B-spline curve, press 'b' on the graph window.
7)To change the degree of the B-Spline, press 'u' on the graph window and input the new degree on the terminal.
8)To quit, press 'q' and the information of the curves will be written in 'output.txt'
9)The press of a, i, d, p can influence each other, press any one of them will turn off the other ones. The press of u will turn off all four of them.

Thank you for your using.:)
